# Description:
Supplementary material for the submission to Pattern Recognition Letters for reproducible research and further development and exploitation of the proposed methods 


# Proposed Multilabel Prototype Generation methods:
- MRHC : Direct implementation of the work in [1]
- MChen : Novel adaptation of the Chen method [2] to the multilabel space introduced in this work
- MRSP1 : Novel adaptation of the RSP (version 1) PG method [3] to the multilabel space introduced in this work
- MRSP2 : Novel adaptation of the RSP (version 2) PG method [3] to the multilabel space introduced in this work
- MRSP3 : Novel adaptation of the RSP (version 3) PG method [3] to the multilabel space introduced in this work


# Multilabel Classifiers implemented (for the experimental evaluation):
- Binary Relevance kNN (BRkNN)
- Label Powerset kNN (LP-kNN)
- Multilabel kNN (MLkNN)


# Usage (reproduction of the results in the original submission):
1) Install dependecies:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Start experimentation:
$ python experiments.py
